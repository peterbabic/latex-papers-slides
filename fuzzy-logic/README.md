# Assignment
The aim is: You choose an application of fuzzy logic and you have to answer
the following questions:

1) what research groups or R & D groups have developed it? (to do this you use
on the web: bibliographic database container containing abstracts and
citations for academic journal articles).

2) State of the art

4) What automatic demonstrator uses?

3) What level of development has ?: Is there software developed?

You will have noted that the bibliographic citations that use must be updated
dates

Work will be descriptive, expressed with your regular expressions (in your
case, in English). Think that an employer wants to know if you can develop
this application

I will not develop any classroom application example, because my goal is to
assess your ability to search, test your knowledge with the challenge of
convincing the employer, etc.
